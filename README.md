Project Name: Marathi Speech Transcription with LLM GPT-2
Overview
This project aims to transcribe Marathi speech data collected from YouTube using Azure services and then apply a Large Language Model (LLM) GPT-2 for further analysis and processing. The project leverages Azure Speech to Text for transcription and Azure Virtual Machine for data processing, providing a comprehensive solution for Marathi speech transcription and analysis.

Key Features
Data Collection from YouTube: Collect Marathi speech data from YouTube to build a diverse and representative dataset.
Azure Speech to Text: Utilize Azure Speech to Text service for accurate and efficient transcription of Marathi speech data.
Azure Virtual Machine: Employ Azure Virtual Machine for data processing tasks such as chunking, denoising, and preparing the data for analysis.
Large Language Model (LLM) GPT-2: Apply the LLM GPT-2 model to the transcribed Marathi text for tasks such as text generation, sentiment analysis, and language understanding.
